        <h1>Joey Bada$$</h1>
        <h2>Curry Chicken</h2>
        <p>Break it

Like "Oh he's broke! I told you he was broke!
I told you he ain't got no money"
Or you know this and that or whatever whatever
Then you'll see some other people
You'll put that you're here in this house
"Oh Joey done made it! 
He bought a crib! He this, he that"
So it's all a story. It's a perception 
That people make for you, along the way
So it's not really what it necessarily 
Is at any point or given at time
And that's the thing that concerns me</p>
        <p> Break it down
We break it down like (break it down)
Joey Bad', he break it down like
My nigga Fly, he break it down like
My nigga Statik, break it down like
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
1-2, 1-2, 1-2, 1-2
            Alright, alright, alright, alright, uhh</p>
